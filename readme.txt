-> Dataset used - NUAA imposter dataset.

-> This directory contains face images output by a face detector. There are 5105 client images and 7509 imposter images in total. Images from each subject are stored in a separate directory.

-> For the Project perpose i have used 15 images of 10 classes from the both client and imposter images.which is in the  dir 1 directory

from dir 1 the samle data is splitted into training an validation set in 7:3 ratio
	1. for  training set:
	client   images: stored in the dir 1 ClientFace directory
	imposter images: stored in the ImposterFace directory

	2. for validation set:
	client   images: stored in the dir 1 ClientFace directory
	imposter images: stored in the dir 1 ImposterFace directory

	3. testing set:
	Any random data taken 45 from each of the calsses of client   images and  imposter images


	4. Finally the  CNN model is created and GUI is developed based on this

	5. All codes are present in Fin.py file
 
			GOOD LUCK
